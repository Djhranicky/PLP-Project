## Executing Programs

So far, I am not familiar with exactly how ANTLR works. I have the ANTLR tools downloaded, and can create the parse trees (cli or gui). Still not sure how generating the java code and running test cases works yet

Followed [this](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md) documentation to get ANTLR running locally.
